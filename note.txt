Why not use GKE?

1. We still need simple deployment and to reduce cost || and haven't needed autoscaling etc
2. If then our users have scaled and maybe if we already have more than one service (microservices)
    then I think we can start to use GKE to utilize autoscaling

Why not use Cloud Run?

1. Haha yes it's more of because I want to experiment further in manual infrastructure management (not just auto like Cloud Run),
    but in real-life case I think it's maybe better to use Cloud Run for the start

Why on port 5000?

1. Well, it's more because of I didn't have enough time to found out how to configure it because of another deadline
    and I think it's not very urgent, so yeah I still leave it as it is
